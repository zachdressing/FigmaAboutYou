//Made a Website using Bootstrap Carousel prefab code, edited to fit my Figma PreCode.
//Peer Review by Aiden Foo: The webiste was neat and the carousels worked well, it was weird that I had to click on the carousel before being able to use the arrows to navigate it but there's nothing that can be done about that.
//in terms of being accurate to teh figma, the website was very accurate except for the "Graduated High School" Picture which is a cap and diploma on the figma, but a picture of Zach in his gown on teh website. The "Goals" page is a little misleading as well
because "finished boy scouts" is only grammatically incorrect since a goal is not usually what you've already accomplished which can be easily fixed by cahnging "Goals" to "Accomplishments"
Everything else was good, the code and implamentation of bootstrap was good as well.
